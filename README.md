## Project Description
This project features three cipher functions: Caesar shift, Polybius square, and Substitution. Each function can take in a message and encode it to a secret message via the specified way. The functions can also take in an encoded message and decode it if given any additional arguments that may be needed. The project also has tests to check the accuracy and edge cases of the functions that were written to account for improperly formatted arguments and missing arguments.
